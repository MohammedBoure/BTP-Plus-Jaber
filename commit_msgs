- Included detailed documentation for running the executable as a Windows Service via NSSM:
  1. Build the exe:
     pyinstaller --noconsole --onedir printer_api.py
  2. Install NSSM and open admin CMD
  3. Run: nssm install PrinterService "C:\path\to\dist\printer_api\printer_api.exe"
  4. Set Startup directory to the exe folder
  5. Start the service: net start PrinterService
